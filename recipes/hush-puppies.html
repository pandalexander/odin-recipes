    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
        <ul>
          <li>
            We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on
            a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount will vary
            depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and
            the specific type of oil used.
