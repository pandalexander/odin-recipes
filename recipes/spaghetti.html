    <h2>This Spaghetti with Meat Sauce Will Replace Your Grandma</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to Italian comfort food, a bowl of spaghetti tossed with a
      tomato-rich meat sauce ranks high. If I’ve got the time, I love spending
      the afternoon slowly simmering a Bolognese sauce. More often than not,
      though, a packed schedule means dinner needs to be a much faster affair.

    <p>
      This quick and easy spaghetti sauce is a total weeknight win. It’s as
      satisfying as a slow-simmered pasta sauce but comes together in less than
      45 minutes — including the time it takes to boil a box of spaghetti.
