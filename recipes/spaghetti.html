    <h2>This Spaghetti with Meat Sauce Will Replace Your Grandma</h2>
    <p class="description">
      When it comes to Italian comfort food, a bowl of spaghetti tossed with a
      tomato-rich meat sauce ranks high. If I’ve got the time, I love spending
      the afternoon slowly simmering a Bolognese sauce. More often than not,
      though, a packed schedule means dinner needs to be a much faster affair.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
      This quick and easy spaghetti sauce is a total weeknight win. It’s as
      satisfying as a slow-simmered pasta sauce but comes together in less than
      45 minutes — including the time it takes to boil a box of spaghetti.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>
        1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for the pasta water tap
        here
      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion and mince 3 garlic cloves.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large high-sided skillet over
        medium-high heat until shimmering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion, garlic, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1 teaspoon of the
        kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and
        1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until
        the beef is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully pour in 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes and season with the
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.
      </li>
      <li>Bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer uncovered until the
        sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Add 1 pound dried spaghetti and cook for 1 minute less than the package
        instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the spaghetti.</li>
      <li>Return the pasta to the pot.</li>
      <li>
        Add the sauce, reserved pasta cooking water, and 2 teaspoons balsamic
        vinegar, and toss to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a simmer over medium heat, tossing continuously, until the
        sauce coats the pasta and everything is evenly combined, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve in bowls topped with lots of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
